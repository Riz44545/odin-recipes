    <h1>Chicken Cordon Bleu</h1>
    <p>This entree is easy and delicious! It's one of my favorites! Try to use the largest chicken breasts you can find so you'll be able to roll them easier.</p>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>A cordon bleu is a dish that traditionally consists of meat wrapped around cheese, then breaded and pan-fried or deep-fried. Many modern versions of the classic French recipe, such as this one, are baked.

        Classic chicken cordon bleu is made with the following ingredients: chicken cutlets, cooked ham, Swiss cheese, bread crumbs, and simple spices. It's usually topped with a rich cream sauce spiked with a hint of Dijon mustard.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>nonstick cooking spray</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>6 slices Swiss cheese</li>
        <li>4 slices cooked ham</li>
        <li>½ cup seasoned bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Step 1
            <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 2
            <p>Pound chicken breasts to 1/4 inch thickness.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 3
            <p>Sprinkle each piece of chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. Place 1 Swiss cheese slice and 1 ham slice on top of each breast. Roll up each breast, and secure with a toothpick. Place in the prepared baking dish, and sprinkle chicken evenly with bread crumbs.

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 4
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink, 30 to 35 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 5
            <p>Remove from the oven, and place 1/2 Swiss cheese slice on top of each breast. Return to the oven until cheese has melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove toothpicks and serve immediately.</p>
