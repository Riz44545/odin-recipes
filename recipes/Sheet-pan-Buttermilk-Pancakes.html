    <h1>Sheet Pan Buttermilk Pancakes</h1>
    <p>Sheet pan pancakes are one of my favorite breakfast hacks for busy mornings or breakfast meal prep. The buttermilk makes these baked pancakes light, fluffy, and oh-so-delicious! This sheet pan pancake recipe can be easily customized by adding your favorite fruit or other pancake toppings on top of the batter before cooking.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>3 cups baking mix (such as Bisquick®)</li>
        <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>¼ cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Step 1
            <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a sheet pan (approx. 13 x18 inches) or jelly roll pan (12x17 inches) with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper with cooking spray.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 2
            <p>Combine baking mix, buttermilk, eggs, sugar, vanilla extract, and cinnamon in a large mixing bowl. Mix until the ingredients are well combined, but don't overmix. Pour batter onto the parchment paper-lined pan.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 3
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, 15 to 18 minutes.

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 4
            <p>Remove sheet pan from the oven. Lift the parchment paper with the pancake from the pan and set it onto a cutting board. Slice the pancake sheet into squares using a pizza cutter or into your desired shapes with a cookie cutter.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
